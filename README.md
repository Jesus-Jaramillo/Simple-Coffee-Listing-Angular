#  Aplication description

It's an Angular-based application. It uses a web API that displays images of different types of coffee, along with their name, price, rating, popularity, and availability. 
It also includes a modal window where you can view the details of the selected product.
For the styling, we used Material UI and Bootstrap, as both technologies offer improved performance when combined across different components. For the API, we used the HttpClient library.
